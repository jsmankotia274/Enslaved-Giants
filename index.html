      <p>Enslaved Giants are units that appeared during the earlier events of Stick War, before later reappearing in the series for it's following media. Depending on the game, the Giants' backstory differs, but throughout its appearances they have originated from the depths of No Man's Land, before being put under the chain of the Order.Giants are very tough, able to lift boulders the size of a Swordwrath. This overwhelming power and stature comes at a cost, being incredibly dimwitted and expensive.</p>

      <h2>Statistics</h2>
      <h3>Abilities</h3>
      <h4>Giant Growth I and II</h4>
      <p>Giant Growth is an upgrade available to Enslaved Giants. It increases their size and health. This allow them to be more effective tank units. Once an upgrade is finished, it is automatically, and instantly applied to all existing giants, including the Tower Spawn 2.
      <br>
There are 2 levels to this upgrade:
      <br>
The first level costs 200 Gold and 200 Mana. However, it takes 40 seconds to research.
      <br>
The second level costs 400 Gold and 400 Mana, but takes 60 seconds to research.</p>

      <h2>Strategies</h2>
      <h3>Uses</h3>
      <span>
         <ul>
            <li>Giants have a slow but powerful, armour piercing attack that stuns on hit. Along with this, they have a large amount of health which results in their main use as absorbing projectiles like arrows for more frail units.</li>
            <li>This protection can be extended to blocking castle archer splash damage by having one giant block the castle arrows.</li>
         </ul>
      </span>
      <h3>Countering</h3>
      <span>
         <ul>
            <li>You have to keep in mind that giants are very powerful but are also equally expensive for the enemy to create. Without miners to get gold there will be no magikill for the enemy to train.</li>
         </ul>
      </span>
      <h2>Notes</h2>
      <span>
         <ul>
            <li>Despite getting longer legs with Giant Growth, Giants still have the same animation speed and walk speed, leading to humorous "moon-walking" as some people call it.</li>
            <li>Despite Giants lacking visible armour, they are still considered armoured by the game. This is probably because of their thick skin.</li>
            <li>Giants can animation cancel which might look like "kiting" or "chasing".</li>
            <li>Giant projectiles do Bonus Damage to Armor</li>
            <li>Both types of Giant are immune to stuns</li>
            <li>Contrary to what people may think, Chaos Giants are not stronger than Order giants in actual gameplay because Order has higher damaging ranged units that will negate the extra health pool of the Chaos giants. Order giants can also continue to fight on low health by attacking when shielded by another Order giant, which Chaos giants cannot do. You can also animation cancel with Order Giants, an act which is more difficult for Chaos giants to perform.</li>
            <li>Giant Growth seems to passively increase range.</li>
            <li>In the Armory the Enslaved Giants say "I big rock throw" which could imply that they are dim-witted</li>
         </ul>
